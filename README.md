# NewsScaper
playing around with python, implementing a cmd based news scraper

- simple web scraper for retrieving the  teaser of the latest news from rheinfelden.de using BeautifulSoup
- the ID of the latest found article is persisted on the file system to set a highlight on the last read article
- only if really a new entry is available
- logo idea taken / forked from https://github.com/sairash/spotify-1975
